# 🚀 DataBridge: PostgreSQL to SQL Server Migration Optimizer

🎓 **Capstone Project** for B.S. in Data Management & Analytics — a proposal and implementation plan to optimize the migration of data from PostgreSQL to SQL Server using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS).

---

## 📌 Project Overview

HS Advantage Inc., a mid-size homeschool curriculum provider, is transitioning its database infrastructure from PostgreSQL to SQL Server to support a new data warehouse initiative. However, their current migration pipeline takes over **8 hours** to move data from PostgreSQL 9.2 (55 tables) to SQL Server — far exceeding the acceptable performance threshold.

👉 SQL Solutions Group has been contracted to reduce the migration time to **under 1 hour**.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

> ⚠️ The current ETL solution developed with SSIS takes ~8 hours to transfer data between systems. Business requirements dictate this process must complete in ≤ 1 hour for timely reporting and analytics.

---

## 🎯 Goals and Objectives

- 🔍 **Understand** the current process through collaboration with HS Advantage Inc.
- 🧠 **Analyze** and identify root causes of the long runtime.
- ⚙️ **Design and implement** an optimized solution using SSIS that consistently performs within the target timeframe.
- 📘 **Deliver** a sustainable solution with proper documentation and training for the in-house IT team.

---

## 📦 Deliverables

- ✅ SSIS solution optimized for sub-hour performance
- 📝 Technical documentation of the process and system design
- 👨‍💻 End-user training for HS Advantage Inc. IT staff

|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1      | 🔎 **Discovery** – Investigate existing SSIS process and identify bottlenecks    | Root cause documented                                    |
| Phase 2      | 🛠️ **Design** – Draft new process flow and SSIS architecture                     | Optimized flowchart and design specification             |
| Phase 3      | 🧪 **Development** – Build and configure new SSIS packages                       | Functional and tested ETL packages                       |
| Phase 4      | 🚀 **Testing & Implementation** – Validate performance in staging environment    | Migration runs in < 1 hour; full test coverage           |
| Phase 5      | 📚 **Handoff** – Train IT staff on usage and maintenance                         | Staff demo skills and documentation handover             |

📅 **Estimated Completion Date**: September 25, XXXX (5-week timeline)
